  <a>Welcome to my personal information project! This page serves as a showcase of my work and interests. I have a deep love for old computers (I even own one!), which brings me back to nostalgic memories of the good old days.
   Here, you will find information about me, details of my computer configuration, and even have the chance to ask me questions in a real terminal-like vibe.</a>
  <br></br>
  <a>This project is built using JavaScript and React.js. I designed the entire computer interface from scratch, utilizing a lot of HTML, CSS, and creativity! While there are still many features and improvements I plan to add, feel free to explore and enjoy the current version.</a>
